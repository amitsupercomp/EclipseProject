======================
		Converting one primitive to another primitive.
		
Derived Casting--->>>>>>
=====================
		Converting from one class type to another class type which are same in the inheritance.
		
		byte 	<	short		<		int		<		long		<		float		<		double
		
		Converting of one numeric type to another numeric type.
		Under numeric type there are three types of 
			---Autowidening---Right hand side narrower and left side is wider.
			If right hand side narrower than left hand side then compiler converting right hand side data type as left hand side type.
				int j= (int)s1;
				long v2 =(long) s1;
				
				2 types-->>
					1.Auto Upcasting-->>Compiler converting subclass type to any object to superclass
					2.Explicit Downcasting-->> We should downcasting explicitly.
