->>>>>>   		You can achieve an abstraction by using abstraction and interface.

you can have concrete and abstract methods in abstract class. Concrete method is a defined method, implemented method. 
Abstract method is called as declared method means it doesn't have body.

declared method should end with semi column without curly brace opening and closing. 
This type of method should declare as an abstract. It should be in abstract.

Why--->>>> When you are not sure about the functioning that time you should use abstract method.

Incompleteness can be represented as abstract keyword.

if class contains minimum one abstract method, then it should be declare as an abstract class.

You can't create Object of an abstract class, but we can create reference.

abstract is only for incompleteness.

abstract class is used as class type purpose, wherever data type is required we can use as abstract class.
