Developing multiple methods with the same name but with different signature. it is method overloading.
Overloaded methods can have any return type.
Overloaded methods can have any access level.(public private protected default)
Overloaded method can be static or non static.
Overloaded method can be abstract and non abstract.    *******
Overloaded method can be final or non final.
we can overload inherited method also.



If superclass method and subclass method same name and same signature, then it is Method Overriding.
return type should be same.
access level should be same or wider.
static should override with static only and non-static should override with non-static only.
final method can't be override.
abstract method should override with a non abstract method.


Superclass is variant and sub class is co-variant.
