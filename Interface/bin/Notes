Interface can become a member of the java file.

When compiling compiler generates class file to the interface also.

It can have only abstract method and don't have constructor.
we can not create an object of Interface.

Wherever data type is required, use an interface.

inside an interface can have abstract methods and constant methods.

Constant is an attribute with a public, static and final keyword.

If any attribute is final that can not be change further.

Every member of the interface is public by default.

final variable should be initialize in interface.

Every method of interface is the public and abstract by default. Every method of interface should end with semi cloumn.

Interface member can not be private can not be protected.

In the interface body default is act as a public.

By default every attribute of interface is public static final.

All abstract methods should implemented in main class

Interface methods can have any return type and argument.

You can not reduce the visibility of method, means every method access modifier should be a public.

Same class can be implemented any number of super interfaces.
It is called multiple inheritance.

Same class implemnting with more than one interface.
Java supports multiple inheritance only through interface.

Java is not supporting multiple inheritance through classes. Java syntax is not allowed to implement more than class is not allowed.

Interface -->>> We can not develop any interface by mentioning super member of a class.

There is no syntax to inherit class into a interface until 1.7JDK.
